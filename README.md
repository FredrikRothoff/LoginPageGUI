# Java Login Page

This is a simple login page made with Java and Java Swing. Please note that this login page is not secure and should not be used in a production environment.

## Installation

To get started, you will need to download the source code for the login page. You can do this by cloning the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-login-page.git
```
Once you have the source code, you can compile and run the program in your preferred Java compiler. The main class is LoginPage.java, which you can run to start the program.

## Usage

The login page is a simple GUI interface that allows users to enter a username and password. If the username and password match the values that are stored in the source code, the user will be logged in and a welcome message will be displayed.

To create a new user, you can add a new username and password combination. Once you have added the new user, you can run the program and log in using the new username and password.

To log in, simply enter the username and password in the text fields and click the "Login" button. If the login is successful, a welcome message will be displayed in a new window.

Please note that this login page is not secure and should not be used in a production environment. The username and password values are stored in plaintext in the source code, making them easily accessible to anyone who has access to the code.

## Customizing the Login Page

If you would like to customize the login page, you can modify the source code as needed. For example, you can change the GUI layout, modify the login logic, or add additional fields for user input.

## Bugs and Issues

Please note that this login page is a simple demo and may have bugs or incomplete features. If you encounter any issues while using the program, please let us know by creating a new issue in the repository.
